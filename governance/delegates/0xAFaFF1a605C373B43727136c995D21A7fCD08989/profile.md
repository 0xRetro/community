### Delegate Statement

I have read, and agree with, the [Recognised Delegate Code of Conduct](https://manual.makerdao.com/governance/what-is-delegation/delegates-code).

As a Maker delegate, I will support the following initiatives:
* **Fixing the governance crisis:** Install a full-time + well-compensated delegate system (no intention to participate due to time constraints)
* **Growing fast & smart:** Pause buybacks/dividends and reinvest into growth instead, augmented by a bigger and more defensive treasury. Consider incentivizing key partners with a strategic investment round
* **Expand to all chains:** Make Maker & Dai one of the leading apps across all blockchains
* **A bank for banks:** Focus on high-value customers, especially centralized lending markets, exchanges and other institutional clients
* **Pragmatic:** Introduce more trust where it makes sense, for example allowing undercollateralized vaults for institutional clients or performing flap auctions off-chain
* **New grounds:** Expand into new experimental asset classes such as NFT

### Activity

I am not a full-time delegate but I have a clear vision for Maker and a strong grasp on the ecosystem. Being a delegate is a passion project for me. To minmax my impact given these constraints, I will focus on the decisions that matter to my vision and that of my backers and ignore almost everything else.

### Conflicts of Interest

I have been an MKR holder for a long time. MKR is one of my biggest holdings, and I want to see the project succeed. I wonâ€™t reveal my portfolio but I have no meaningful stake in any Maker competitor. If that ever changes, I will disclose it.
I currently lead Strategy at Flashbots
