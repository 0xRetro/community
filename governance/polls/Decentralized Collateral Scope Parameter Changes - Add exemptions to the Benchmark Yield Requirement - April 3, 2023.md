This Governance [Poll](https://manual.makerdao.com/governance/governance-cycle/weekly-governance-cycle#weekly-governance-cycle-definitions-mip16c1) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, April 3 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.**
- **You may vote for a single option.**

Please review the originating [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/decentralized-collateral-scope-parameter-changes-1-april-2023/20302) by the Facilitator of the [Decentralized Collateral Scope Framework](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP104) to help inform your position before voting.

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**
* These above exemptions will be included in an upcoming Executive Vote as the Protocol Engineering Core Unit's schedule allows.
* It is expected that this Executive Vote will take place within 30 days of this poll passing, absent external factors.
* If the Executive Vote passes, then this change will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://manual.makerdao.com/parameter-index/core/param-gsm-pause-delay) has expired.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
