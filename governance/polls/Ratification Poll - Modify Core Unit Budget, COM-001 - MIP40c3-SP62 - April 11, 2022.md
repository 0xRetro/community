The Governance Facilitators have placed a ratification poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) as part of the responsibilities defined in [MIP51](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP51). This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for fourteen days beginning on Monday, April 11 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.**

- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

**The Governance Communications Core Unit (COM-001) has also submitted an alternative budget (MIP40c3-SP63)** that includes a plan for a 4th full-time hire. The Ratification Poll for said alternative budget will run in parallel to this one. If both this and the alternative budget subproposals pass, the alternative budget will be executed and this one will be discarded, as per the [Contingent Execution clause](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/blob/a986f68a7eee495ea838d21f5f626a23fd94065b/MIP40/MIP40c3-Subproposals/MIP40c3-SP62.md#contingent-execution) contained in the latter.

## Outcomes

This poll implements a **Minimum Positive Participation** value. The Minimum Positive Participation is currently set to **10,000 MKR**.

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option AND the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed 10,000 MKR, then the following actions will be taken:**
* The MIP Editors will mark the proposal **Accepted** and the Governance Facilitators will confirm its passage on the Governance and Risk call on Thursday, April 28. 
* Any further work required to implement the proposal will be tasked to the relevant [Core Units](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP38#mip38c2-core-unit-state).

**Otherwise, this proposal will be marked as rejected per [MIP51](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP51#mip51c2-ratification-poll).**
