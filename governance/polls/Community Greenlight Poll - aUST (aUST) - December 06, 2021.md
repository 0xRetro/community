# Poll: Community Greenlight Poll - aUST (aUST) - December 06, 2021

The Governance Facilitators have placed a governance poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) as part of their responsibilities as defined in [MIP9: Community Greenlight](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP9). This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for fourteen days beginning on December 06, 2021 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.** 
- **You may vote for a single option.** 
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

This poll asks whether the asset aUST (aUST) should be prioritized for inclusion in the Maker Protocol by the [Core Units](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP38#mip38c2-core-unit-state). 

Please review the collateral onboarding application [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/aust-mip6-aust-collateral-onboarding-application/11494) to inform your position before voting.

## Outcomes

**Regardless of the winning option the following actions will be taken at the conclusion of this poll:**
* The 'greenlight score' will be calculated for aUST (aUST) using the formula `Score = 'Yes' Votes - 'No' Votes`
* The 'greenlight score' for aUST (aUST) will be added to the [Collateral Prioritisation Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IX9e2fyfz7djtDMKn5gMyGsyFxHoY75GncMbAjnSXrM/edit#gid=0) by the Governance Facilitators.
* The [Core Units](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP38#mip38c2-core-unit-state) will use the Collateral Prioritisation Sheet to direct their work on onboarding new collateral types.
