# Poll: Recentering Maker Brand - November 4, 2024

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system in accordance with Atlas article [A.5.2 - Brand Identity - Recentering Maker Brand Polls](https://github.com/makerdao/next-gen-atlas/blob/0ad10bf7adb809299f2e35ca048b62708a3bbb6c/Sky%20Atlas/Sky%20Atlas.html#L8697BD). This Governance [Poll](https://sky-atlas.powerhouse.io/#A.1.9.1_Operational_Weekly_Cycle-b189fa17-57a9-4d4e-9780-0ce4efd94211|0db30308) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, November 4 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a plurality vote.**

- **You may vote for a single option.**
- **You should vote for the option that you prefer.**
- **If you would accept any of the options you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community can vote in this poll to express support or opposition to either one or none of the following options:

- Option 1 - Keep the Sky brand as the backend protocol brand.
- Option 2 - Recenter the Maker brand.
- Option 3 - Recenter the Maker brand with a limited brand refresh.

Please review the discussion [thread](https://forum.sky.money/t/weekly-atlas-edit-proposal-week-of-2024-10-28-0/25411) and the originating Atlas article [A.5.2 - Brand Identity - Recentering Maker Brand Polls](https://github.com/makerdao/next-gen-atlas/blob/0ad10bf7adb809299f2e35ca048b62708a3bbb6c/Sky%20Atlas/Sky%20Atlas.html#L8697BD) to help inform your position before voting.

**Note that the Governance Portal does not currently support the specified winning criteria (described under **Outcome**) for this poll. In order to minimize confusion, this vote will have no winner displayed on the Governance Portal; however, the winning criteria will still apply at the end of it and the winner will be acknowledged in a subsequent forum post by the Governance Facilitators.**

## Outcomes

**The winning criteria for this poll are as follows:**

- The option with the most votes will be selected as the winning choice.
- However, if Option 1 has the most votes individually, but the combined votes for Options 2 and 3 exceed those for Option 1, Option 2 will be declared the winner.
