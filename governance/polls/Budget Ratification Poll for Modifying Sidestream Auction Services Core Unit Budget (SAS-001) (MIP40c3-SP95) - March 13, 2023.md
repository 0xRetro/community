# Budget Ratification Poll for Modifying Sidestream Auction Services Core Unit Budget (SAS-001) (MIP40c3-SP95) - March 13, 2023

The Governance Facilitators have placed a budget ratification poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) as part of the responsibilities defined in [MIP51](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP51). This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for fourteen days beginning on Monday, March 13 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.**
- **You may vote for a single option.**
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community may vote in this poll to express support or opposition to MIP40c3-SP95 being accepted and implemented in the Maker Protocol.

A brief summary of this proposal has been provided by the MIP Author and is shown below:

*The original budget for SAS-001 expired on 30-Nov-2022. Afterward, SAS was allowed to operate on leftover funds to bridge the funding gap. This proposal creates a new budget stream for the Core Unit to continue operations from 2023-04-01 onwards.*

*The structure of the budget maximizes accountability in light of the current uncertainty on precise Endgame requirements. As SAS transitions towards becoming a Full-Stack Development Ecosystem Actor for the Endgame, this budget will cover:*

- *Pre-Project Endgame Work (current examples include: Contributing to Governance Security -Scope creation, Evaluation of a NoCode Tool for Spell creation, various contributions to increase developer accessibility)*
- *Maintenance of Existing Software (Auctions UI and APIs, …)*

*As we want to operate as transparently as possible, every time SAS finds an opportunity with a clearly defined project with a fixed budget, we’ll use the project budget instead of the CU budget.*

*A current example: For at least the next two months, we’ll be working on the Ecosystem API (Switchboard) Project. The respective monthly project budget will cover 60-80 % of the monthly CU budget. This means that 60-80 % of the SAS CU budget during these months will be refunded to the DAO. Overtime, as more Endgame projects become clearer, there will be various project budgets available. Therefore, the CU budget will be used less.*

*This subproposal creates a new budget stream for the Core Unit to continue operations from 2023-04-01 to 2024-03-31.*
