# Poll:Offboard TUSD-A - March 07, 2022

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the MakerDAO Community. This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, March 07 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.** 
- **You may vote for a single option.** 
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community can vote in this poll to express support or opposition to the following changes: 
* Implement risk parameters for offboarding TUSD-A
* Do not implement them

The Risk Core Unit Team is proposing the following parameter changes to TUSD-A which will liquidate current open positions.

* Proposed Offboarding Parameters

* Enable liquidations
* Use Abacus/LinearDecrease â€“ tau [seconds]
* Set [Liquidation Penalty](https://makerdao.world/en/learn/governance/param-liquidation-penalty/) to 0
* Set [Liquidation Ratio](https://makerdao.world/en/learn/governance/param-liquidation-ratio/) to 150%
* Set buf to 1
* Set ilk.hole to 5m
* Set tau to 21,600,000 second (est. 10bps drop per 6 hours = 250 days till 0)
* Set tail to 432,000 second (5 days, implies minimum price of 0.98)
* cusp not relevant, stays the same (tail will stop the auction)
* Set chip to 0 (no need to be fast)
* Set tip to 500 (bit higher value so that we guarantee kicking all vaults)

Please review the discussion [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/proposed-parameters-for-offboarding-tusd-a/13506) to help inform your position before voting.

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**
* This change will be included in the weekly Executive Vote on the Friday following the conclusion of this poll.
* If the Friday executive passes, then this change will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/param-gsm-pause-delay) has expired.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
