# Poll:Initial Parameters for StarkNet Simple Bridge - March 28, 2022

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the MakerDAO Community. This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, March 28 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.** 
- **You may vote for a single option.** 
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community can vote in this poll to express support or opposition to the following changes: 
* Implementing the following parameters for the deployment of StarkNet Simple Bridge:

**Proposed Initial Parameters**

* Establish a simple bridge limit of 5MM DAI. 
* The scope of the simple bridge is slow withdrawal, fast withdrawals are out of scope for this release. 
* The bridge limit is the maximum amount of DAI that can be in the L1 bridge contract. Hence it is the maximum amount that can be lost by users.
* The bridge launch will require the completion of all the mandatory items on the [checklist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lg4LFQCW7x4bcR8gEgHoE7DB2rqa4GA4DPSUdMOgBsI/edit#gid=718243816).
* Users will use the simple bridge at their own risk. It will be mentioned on the bridge interface

Please review the discussion [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/starknet-simple-bridge-limit-poll-risk-assessment-mitigation/14158) to help inform your position before voting.

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**
* This change will be included in the weekly Executive Vote on the Friday following the conclusion of this poll.
* If the Friday executive passes, then this change will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/param-gsm-pause-delay) has expired.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
