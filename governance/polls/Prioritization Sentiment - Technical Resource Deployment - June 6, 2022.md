# Poll: Prioritization Sentiment - Technical Resource Deployment - June 6, 2022

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Priority Sentiment Poll into the voting system on behalf of MKR holders. This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for 4 weeks beginning on Monday, June 6 at 16:00 UTC.


**This is an instant-runoff vote.** 
- **You may rank any number of options that you would support for priority consideration.** 
- **Unranked options signal that you would not support the option(s) for priority consideration.**
- **If you have no priority preference to any of the listed options, you should vote 'Abstain' as your first and only choice.**

## Review

The community can vote in this poll to rank their support of the following options:
* $A_Detailed
* $B_Detailed
* $C_Detailed
* $D_Detailed
* $E
* $F
* $G
* $H
* $I
* $J
* $K
* $L

Please review the discussion [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/prioritization-framework-sentiment-polling/15554) to help inform your position before voting.

**Note: The voting portal will display the "leader" of the Ranked Choice Vote as the poll continues, and the "winning option" upon completion. These assertations should be ignored. For updates on the state of the vote, check below this text for the weekly updates from GovAlpha and live explorer from Data Insights.**

## Outcomes

**Weekly updates will be shared with the Maker Community to detail the feedback from Priority Sentiment Polls. No Governance action will be mandated upon their conclusion. It is GovAlpha's hope that these polls will:**
- Encourage more dialoge between MKR holders and Core Units about prioritization.
- Convey valuable MKR sentiment to those contributing to the DAO.

Suggestions for items to be included on future Priority Sentiment Polls may be submitted [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScGMqLqzV-ySAiU_AhqeVuwGwgYFGpTYpEDvdNSzXo9Wi4U-w/viewform?usp=sf_link) along with additional feedback for the process as a whole.
