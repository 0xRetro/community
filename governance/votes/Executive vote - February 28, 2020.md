The Maker Foundation Interim Governance Facilitator has placed an Executive Vote into the voting system, which will enable the community to approve the following alterations to the protocol:

- [Lower the Sai Debt Ceiling by 5 million to 25 million Sai](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmfy3resrmo97rqyfffpndujszvbv59zuacfl3rxpcu2wx)
- [Lower the Dai ETH Debt Ceiling by 20 million to 130 million Dai](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmfy3resrmo97rqyfffpndujszvbv59zuacfl3rxpcu2wx)
- [Set the Dai Savings Rate Spread to 1%](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmewwftkvpcnqzmfrskryenlpqj4qqxqtzi9djxa8k9wn3)
  - Note: This will set the DSR to 7% 

The Executive Vote ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-scd-faqs/scd-faqs#governance)) will continue until the number of votes surpass the total in favor of the previous Executive Vote. This is a [continuous approval](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-scd-faqs/scd-faqs/governance#what-is-continuous-approval-voting) vote.
