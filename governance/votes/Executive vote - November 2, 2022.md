## Proposal Details

### Maker Teleport Technical Deployment on Starknet
As per the outcome of successful Governance Polls [here](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmbWkTvW) and [here](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmZxRgvG), [Maker Teleport (formerly known as Maker Wormhole)](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/introducing-maker-wormhole/11550) will be deployed on [Starknet](https://starkware.co/starknet/), if this executive passes.

The Maker Teleport parameters will be set as follows:

* The [Debt Ceiling](https://manual.makerdao.com/parameter-index/vault-risk/param-debt-ceiling) will be set to **100,000 DAI**.

* **MKR Stream #23** going to the [Strategic Happiness Core Unit (SH-001)](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP39c2SP11) will be cancelled as a result of a successful [offboarding proposal](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP39c3SP3).
