The Maker Foundation Interim Governance Facilitator has placed an Executive Vote into the voting system, which will enable the community to approve the following alteration to the protocol:

- [Unblock the remaining Debt Auctions - March 23, 2020](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmf4pkdzu8ehfaqmqnqwqt5cfcxxqpyvsbptlau5dst5dd)

The Executive Vote ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-scd-faqs/scd-faqs#governance)) will continue until the number of votes surpass the total in favor of the previous Executive Vote. This is a [continuous approval](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-scd-faqs/scd-faqs/governance#what-is-continuous-approval-voting) vote.

## Review

1MM in bad debt was not covered by the recent debt auctions due to a protocol bug. This change will start auctions for the remaining bad debt. To ensure a predictable start time for the auctions, after being voted in and undergoing the governance delay, this change can only be effected between 12 PM and 2 PM EDT on March 27th or any subsequent weekday (until the spell expires after 30 days).

This [forum post](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/blocked-flops-debt-auctions-everything-you-need-to-know/1748) contains more detailed background information.

This change was discussed in the Governance call on Thursday, March 26. Please review the [Video](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLzkWCj8ywWNq5-90-Id6VPSsrk4OWVan), [Audio](https://soundcloud.com/makerdao/sets/governance-and-risk), and the online [discussion](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/blocked-flops-debt-auctions-everything-you-need-to-know/1748) to inform your position before voting.

The MakerDAO community is moving forward with an Executive Vote to determine whether it will enact the changes established by the previous [Governance Poll](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling).
