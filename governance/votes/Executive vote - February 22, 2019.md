The increased stability fee was discussed in the [Governance call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKDpN1fe0cU&amp;feature=youtu.be) on Thursday, February 21. Key factors under consideration for increasing the stability fee are:

- High inventory levels.
- Exchange rate persists below $1.
- No attributable impact from the previous stability fee increase.
- Additional future increases at potentially greater magnitudes.
