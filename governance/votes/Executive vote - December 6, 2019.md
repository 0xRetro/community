The Maker Foundation Interim Governance Facilitator has placed an Executive Vote into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/), which will enable the community to approve a series of alterations to the protocol:

- [**Debt Ceiling Adjustment**](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmdbmfcrluuggzwhjmxyv8uqkpyno1rurfrnk3hjezqhuw):
  - Lower the Sai Debt Ceiling by 25 million to 95 million Sai
  - Raise the Dai ETH Debt Ceiling by 25 million to 75 million Dai
  - Raise the Global Debt Ceiling in MCD to 178 M
- [**Dai Savings Rate Adjustment**](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmxt6giqs42mxr4uskyxaunuw1ua4txwgtnxw4ogbuusht): 
  - Raise the DSR by 2% to a new total of 4%
- [**Sai Stability Fee Adjustment**](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmdzulyrarbq24ccqcqf5qjdqggk4oa2ycxnuqvlnjjrah)
  - Lower the Sai Stability Fee by 1% to a new total of 3%

The Executive Vote ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/governance/governance#is-there-more-than-one-type-of-vote)) will continue until the number of votes surpasses the total in favor of the previous Executive Vote. This is a [continuous approval](https://community-development.makerdao.com/governance/governance#what-is-continuous-approval-voting) vote.
