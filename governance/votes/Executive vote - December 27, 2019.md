The Maker Foundation Interim Governance Facilitator has placed an Executive Vote into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/), which will enable the community to approve an alteration to the protocol:

- [**Debt Ceiling Adjustment**](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmd2kxkcjgsxe96on9krxwmo46g8wjg8wffmyjybjnupz2):
  - Lower the Sai Debt Ceiling by 25 million to 70 million Sai
  - Raise the Dai ETH Debt Ceiling by 25 million to 100 million Dai

The Executive Vote ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-scd-faqs/scd-faqs/governance#is-there-more-than-one-type-of-vote)) will continue until the number of votes surpasses the total in favor of the previous Executive Vote. This is a [continuous approval](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-scd-faqs/scd-faqs/governance#what-is-continuous-approval-voting) vote.
