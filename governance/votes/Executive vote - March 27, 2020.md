The Maker Foundation Interim Governance Facilitator has placed an Executive Vote into the voting system, which will enable the community to approve the following alterations to the protocol:

- [Lower the USDC Stability Fee from 20% to 16%](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmtmgczpt4fnayxqxggwxansej9f8wqs8mqwzwttvr2anx)
- [Lower the Dai ETH Debt Ceiling by 10 million to 90 million Dai](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmqbhuhuw6fhhtjw4k5rchcsvkeowhrgw2g1aaqafg96dp)

The Executive Vote ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-scd-faqs/scd-faqs#governance)) will continue until the number of votes surpass the total in favor of the previous Executive Vote. This is a [continuous approval](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-scd-faqs/scd-faqs/governance#what-is-continuous-approval-voting) vote.
