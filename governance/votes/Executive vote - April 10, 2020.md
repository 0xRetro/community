The Maker Foundation Interim Governance Facilitator has placed an Executive Vote into the voting system, which will enable the community to approve the following alterations to the protocol:

- [Raise the USDC Stability Fee from 12% to 16%](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmwtwpa8fxd7r4x2dhdauo2gpb1kfrc3gt7mhdtzmv4e2o)
- [Raise the Sai Stability Fee from 8% to 8.5%](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmej8jxjscw9wznah7rrccgkrmsy4bcyt3bfhpwr1qwwyv)
- [Raise the Dai Stability Fee from 0.5% to 1%](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmcdbetspgy9jkfrfdvgzbwtemrkfgfmeaysudlruz2j5r)
    - Note: This will set the DSR to 0.5%


The Executive Vote ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-scd-faqs/scd-faqs#governance)) will continue until the number of votes surpass the total in favor of the previous Executive Vote. This is a [continuous approval](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-scd-faqs/scd-faqs/governance#what-is-continuous-approval-voting) vote.
