The Maker Foundation Interim Governance Facilitator has placed an Executive Vote into the voting system, which will enable the community to approve alterations to the protocol:

- [Lower the Sai Debt Ceiling by 5 million to 25 million Sai](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmzuvnyapyyu6rg9qwza1gy3yzaopeho6er8equy2ukqcf)
- [Suspend monetary policy votes when there are emergency technical changes to be made to the system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmesunxbhbf8uzec4e7mzvrgz52ke6srckqis5got4m1tc)

The Executive Vote ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-scd-faqs/scd-faqs#governance)) will continue until the number of votes surpass the total in favor of the previous Executive Vote. This is a [continuous approval](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-scd-faqs/scd-faqs/governance#what-is-continuous-approval-voting) vote.
