The Maker Foundation Interim Governance Facilitator has placed an Executive Vote into the voting system, which will enable the community to approve the following alteration to the protocol:

- [Set the Dai Savings Rate Spread to 1%](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmewwftkvpcnqzmfrskryenlpqj4qqxqtzi9djxa8k9wn3)
  - Note: This will set the DSR to 7% 

The Executive Vote ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-scd-faqs/scd-faqs#governance)) will continue until the number of votes surpass the total in favor of the previous Executive Vote. This is a [continuous approval](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-scd-faqs/scd-faqs/governance#what-is-continuous-approval-voting) vote.
