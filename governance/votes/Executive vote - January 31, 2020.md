The Maker Foundation Interim Governance Facilitator has placed an Executive Vote into the voting system, which will enable the community to approve alterations to the protocol:

- [Raise the Dai Stability Fee from 8% to 9%](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmwmenqrlzv7wclleq5u5qy1stfafx3ihmo9rtr2jqyteb)
  - Note: With the current Dai Savings Rate Spread of 0.25%, the DSR will also increase to 8.75%
- [Raise the Sai Stability Fee from 9% to 10%](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmnetpqqvu8wn2s86r6qt7f46s2spxaprkd9qeg6jhyzq1)
- [Lower the Sai Debt Ceiling by 15 million to 30 million Sai](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmqdc58bqcfeekfn53kdcerf1xdqnkerxem86qtdrbqobh)

The Executive Vote ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-scd-faqs/scd-faqs#governance)) will continue until the number of votes surpass the total in favor of the previous Executive Vote. This is a [continuous approval](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-scd-faqs/scd-faqs/governance#what-is-continuous-approval-voting) vote.
