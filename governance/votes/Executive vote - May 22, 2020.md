The Maker Foundation Interim Governance Facilitator has placed an Executive Vote into the voting system, which will enable the community to approve the following alterations to the protocol:

- [Change the Stability Fee Structure to allow a negative Base Rate](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmnun5btup2jmo5pnggsy2wviguzrpsqweb3aijn5muth3)
- [Raise the USDC Stability Fee from 0% to 0.75%](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmazm9hrxelg9umc5nrnoeurzzg2k4mvjcwbdv7tp5zlzz)

The Executive Vote ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-mcd-faqs/faqs#governance)) will continue until the number of votes surpass the total in favor of the previous Executive Vote. This is a [continuous approval](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-mcd-faqs/faqs/governance#what-is-continuous-approval-voting) vote.
