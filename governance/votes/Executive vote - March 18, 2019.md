The Maker Foundation Interim Risk Team will place three Governance Poll proposals into the voting system to raise the Dai Stability Fee by 0%, 2%, and 4%.

The Governance Polling ([FAQ](https://makerdao.com/en/faq/voting#what-is-governance-voting)) will be active for 3 days beginning on Monday, March 18th at 6pm UTC, the results of which will inform an Executive Vote ([FAQ](https://makerdao.com/en/faq/voting#what-is-governance-voting)) which will go live on Friday, March 22th, at 5pm UTC.

## Review

The increase to the Stability Fee was discussed in the Governance call on Thursday, March 14th. Please review the [Video](https://youtu.be/COQxy2IePqQ), [Audio](https://soundcloud.com/makerdao/ep-26-governance-and-risk-meeting?in=makerdao/sets/governance-and-risk), [Transcript](https://github.com/makerdao/community/blob/master/governance/transcripts/Governance%20and%20Risk%20Meeting:%20Ep.%2026.md) and the online [discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/mkrgov/comments/b17ap9/discussion_scientific_governance_and_risk/) to inform your position prior to voting. 

Key factors under consideration for increasing the Stability Fee are:

- Exchange price persists below $1
- High inventory levels among market makers and prop desks
- Little attributable impact from the previous Stability Fee increases

## Analysis

In February, the Stability Fee was increased twice, each time by 0.5%. The impact of this combined 1% increase was negligible, indicating that neither the target Stability Fee nor the incremental change was appropriate. 

Based on last week’s governance call, the MakerDAO community is moving forward with a Governance Poll to gauge sentiment for an additional Stability Fee increase. The Interim Foundation Risk Team has put together a summary of the different choices:

**No change:** Leave the Stability Fee at 3.5%. 
The argument for no change is due primarily to the slight uptrend in the Dai price from $0.96 to $0.985. Because this increase has occurred on low volume, it is difficult to determine whether or not the effect of last week’s Stability Fee increase has finished running its course. A ‘wait and see’ approach could allow more time for users to continue wiping down their CDPs and/or speculators to push the Dai price up.

**2% increase:** Increase the Stability Fee to 5.5%
The absence of any significant volume clearing near $1 indicates that there needs to be stronger incentives in place. A 2% increase would keep the steady cadence going and push market participants one step closer towards purchasing Dai at $1. Unchanged market maker inventories suggest that there is still more increases needed in the Stability Fee before supply/demand equilibrium is reached. A 2% increase would be in accordance with previous increments used.

**4% increase:** Increase the Stability Fee to 7.5%
A larger increase could also be considered given the perceived differential before CDP users are incentivized to start aggressively closing CDPs. Depending on the potential short term risks to a misaligned peg, a 4% increase could be warranted to swiftly close the gap. This would be the largest one-time raise, and runs the risk of overshooting our estimate. Of course, the correct Stability Fee could still be 7.5% or higher. 

## Next Steps

- On Friday, March 22nd there will be an Executive Vote asking MKR token holders if they support or reject the change proposed by this Governance Poll.
- If the results of that Executive Vote is insufficient to manage inventory levels as measured over the following 5 days, another proposal will be put forth for a subsequent increase.
