The Maker Foundation Interim Governance Facilitator has placed an Executive Vote into the voting system, which will enable the community to approve the following alteration to the protocol:

- Lower the Dai Stability Fee from 4% to 0.5%
- Increase the Dai Savings Rate Spread to 0.5%
  - Note: This will set the Dai Savings Rate to 0%
- Lower the SCD debt ceiling 5M to 20M
- Reduce the Governance Security Module delay from 24 hours to 4 hours
- Activate the Liquidation Freeze Module

The Executive Vote ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-scd-faqs/scd-faqs#governance)) will continue until the number of votes surpass the total in favor of the previous Executive Vote. This is a [continuous approval](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-scd-faqs/scd-faqs/governance#what-is-continuous-approval-voting) vote.

## Review

As detailed in this [forum post](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/proposal-for-immediate-changes-and-executive-vote/1545), the Protocol needs additional protection to strengthen itself in light of a system-wide Dai shortage and to protect itself against another potential ETH price crash in this very volatile market.

The rationale for holding this vote outside of the traditional weekly cycle is discussed in detail in the forum post above. Please join the ongoing discussion at forum.makerdao.com and review the discussion to inform your position before voting.

## Action

**Voting for this proposal will place your MKR in support of implementing the parameter changes outlined above.**
