The Maker Foundation Interim Governance Facilitator has placed an Executive Vote into the voting system, which will enable the community to approve alterations to the protocol:

- [Lower the Dai Stability Fee from 9% to 8%](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qme2xyi1xb4vfxfyegx9aiqlweigchjkswp253yqujxp7r)
- [Raise the Dai Savings Rate Spread from 0.25% to 0.5%](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmpxz2mzpsttprkt1gqw6k4wezs319k5nvsuyk27dp6ask)
    - Note: With the Stability Fee changing to 8% and the Dai Savings Rate Spread changing to 0.5%, the DSR will become 7.5% if the vote passes
- [Lower the Sai Stability Fee from 10% to 9%](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmdst7a2vysztqjajadagqcyfg3b5gezt82kj4bjeavzjf)

The Executive Vote ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-scd-faqs/scd-faqs#governance)) will continue until the number of votes surpass the total in favor of the previous Executive Vote. This is a [continuous approval](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-scd-faqs/scd-faqs/governance#what-is-continuous-approval-voting) vote.
