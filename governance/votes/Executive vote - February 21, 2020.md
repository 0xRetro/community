The Maker Foundation Interim Governance Facilitator has placed an Executive Vote into the voting system, which will enable the community to approve the following alterations to the protocol:

- [Raise the Dai Debt Ceiling by 25 million to 150 million Dai](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmsm1q1hohyctsgxpbm44fomjoukf1d5g9lmpqraikmeoc)
- [Set the Dai Savings Rate Spread to 0%](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmss9hnszwr6egq3xn6gpx4u8bz8cajja56rgtanjev1v8)
- [Set the Sai Stability Fee to 9.5%](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmaj4fnjeohomnrs8m9cihrfxws4m89bwfu9eh96y8okxw)
- [Lower the minimum Surplus Auction bid to 2%](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmtsxrqavtczfsseytpypgqrz6z8zb613ikxwhqjv9ytzz)
- [Set the Governance Security Module Delay to 24 hours](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-should-we-have-another-executive-vote-regarding-the-governance-security-module/1209)

The Executive Vote ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-scd-faqs/scd-faqs#governance)) will continue until the number of votes surpass the total in favor of the previous Executive Vote. This is a [continuous approval](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-scd-faqs/scd-faqs/governance#what-is-continuous-approval-voting) vote.
