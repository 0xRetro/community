The Maker Foundation Interim Governance Facilitator has placed an Executive Vote into the voting system, which will enable the community to approve the following alterations to the protocol:

- [Raise the Base Rate from 0% to 1%](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmyyuvc3fphgt9bqotkedijxt5mpnjfktz3je9c2cspfae)

This adjustment will set the following Stability Fees:

- ETH-A: **1%**
- BAT-A: **1%**
- USDC-A: **1.75%**
- USDC-B: **51%**
- WBTC-A: **2%**
- TUSD-A: **1%**

The DSR will also be set to **1%**

The Executive Vote ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-mcd-faqs/faqs#governance)) will continue until the number of votes surpass the total in favor of the previous Executive Vote. This is a [continuous approval](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-mcd-faqs/faqs/governance#what-is-continuous-approval-voting) vote.
