The Maker Foundation Governance Facilitator has placed an Executive Vote into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/), which will enable the community to lower the USDC-A Liquidation ratio and approve a new Gitcoin light feed key:

Lower the USDC-A Liquidation Ratio to 110%
- This will lower the USDC-A Liquidation ratio from 120% to 110%. Note, there will be no changes to the USDC-A stability fee or debt ceiling. For more information please review this [Signal Thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-lower-the-usdc-a-liquidation-ratio-and-risk-premium/3296).

Approve a New Gitcoin Light Feed Key 
- This will enable Gitcoin to continue operating as a Maker light feed. This has been confirmed by signed message between Gitcoin and the Maker Oracle Team on the [Maker Forum](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip10c14-sp4-proposal-appoint-gitcoin-as-a-light-feed/2811/6).


The Executive Vote ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-mcd-faqs/faqs#governance)) will continue until the number of votes surpass the total in favor of the previous Executive Vote. This is a [continuous approval](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-mcd-faqs/faqs/governance#what-is-continuous-approval-voting) vote.
