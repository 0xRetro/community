If this executive proposal passes, following the recommendation of the Governance Facilitators in collaboration with the spell team, the following operations will be performed:

- Raise the PSM_PAX_A Debt Ceiling to **100,000 DAI**.
- Call `push(uint256 amt)` on the the PSM_PAX_A_INPUT_CONDUIT_JAR contract with an amount of **84,211.27 USDP**, depositing the contents of the contract to the PSM and receiving an identical amount of Dai into the PSM_PAX_A_JAR contract.
- Call `void()` on the PSM_PAX_A_JAR contract to deposit the Dai to the Surplus Buffer.
- Set PSM-PAX-A Debt Ceiling to **0 DAI**.
- Decrease Debt Ceiling of PSM_PAX_A back to **0 DAI**.

This will have the following net results:

- The PSM_PAX_A Debt Debt Ceiling remains at 0 DAI after the transaction has been executed.

- USDP balance of MCD_JOIN_PSM_PAX_A increases by **84,211.27 USDP**.
