This Governance Poll ([FAQ](https://makerdao.com/en/faq/voting#what-is-governance-voting)) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, April 8th at 5 PM UTC, the results of which will inform an Executive Vote ([FAQ](https://makerdao.com/en/faq/voting#what-is-governance-voting)) which will go live on Friday, April 12th, at 5 PM UTC.

## Review

The need to increase to the Stability Fee was discussed in the Governance call on Thursday, March 14th. Please review the [Video](https://youtu.be/O_KgWtc6UKU), [Audio](https://soundcloud.com/makerdao/ep-29-governance-and-risk-meeting), [Transcript](https://github.com/makerdao/community/tree/master/governance/transcripts) and the online [discussion](https://redd.it/b97y4o) to inform your position before voting.

Key factors under consideration for increasing the Stability Fee are:
- Exchange price persists below $1
- High inventory levels among market makers and prop desks
- Little attributable impact from the previous Stability Fee increases

## Analysis

In February, the Stability Fee was increased twice, each time by 0.5%. In March, the Fee was raised by an additional 2%, and then by 4% two weeks later. The impact of these combined increases was negligible, indicating that neither the target Stability Fee nor the incremental changes were appropriate.

In light of this, the MakerDAO community is moving forward with a Governance Poll to gauge sentiment for an additional Stability Fee increase. The Interim Foundation Risk Team has put together a proposal that includes a range of options. Voters may signal their support for a Stability Fee increase of: 0%, +1%, +2%, +3%, or +4%.

## Action
**Voting for this proposal will signal your support for increasing the stability fee by 3%, bringing it to 10.5% per year.**

## Next Steps

- On the Friday following the conclusion of the poll, there will be an Executive Vote asking MKR token holders if they support or reject the change proposed by this Governance Poll.
- **This cycle of weekly Polling and Voting will continue until the community believes that stability has returned to the peg.**
