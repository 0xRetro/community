The Maker Foundation Interim Governance Facilitator has placed an Executive Vote into the voting system, which will enable the community to approve the following alterations to the protocol:

- [Lower the USDC Stability Fee from 12% to 8%](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmrdmj78a6es5vas3e6vwncmhqx1txugc8myufh1xhadcj)
- [Raise the Sai Stability Fee from 8% to 8.5%](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmslmbd8pxjnadxxq2gezdd56fd11dpvcwxdfeevnrew96)
- [Lower the Dai Stability Fee from 0.5% to 0%](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmxzfqgn6oxwnz4xmuhcjltymzw3jetm56qkhdisyks5u8)
    - Note: This will set the DSR to 0%


The Executive Vote ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-scd-faqs/scd-faqs#governance)) will continue until the number of votes surpass the total in favor of the previous Executive Vote. This is a [continuous approval](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-scd-faqs/scd-faqs/governance#what-is-continuous-approval-voting) vote.
