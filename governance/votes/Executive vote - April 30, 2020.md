The Maker Foundation Interim Risk Team has placed an Executive Vote into the voting system, which will enable the community to approve the following alterations to the protocol:

- Raise the ETH Debt Ceiling by 20 million to 120 million

The Executive Vote ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-scd-faqs/scd-faqs#governance)) will continue until the number of votes surpass the total in favor of the previous Executive Vote. This is a [continuous approval](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-scd-faqs/scd-faqs/governance#what-is-continuous-approval-voting) vote.

## Review

The currently proposed Debt Ceiling increase is no longer suitable to maintain a healthy Dai supply due to a midweek uptick in the price of ETH. This executive vote will invalidate the current poll and institute an immediate change to the ETH debt ceiling, raising it to 120 million Dai.

The MakerDAO community is moving forward with an Executive Vote to determine whether it will enact the changes established by the previous [Governance Polls](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling).

## Action

**Voting for this proposal will place your MKR in support of implementing the  changes outlined above.**
