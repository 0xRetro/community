Unless otherwise noted, the changes and additions listed above are subject to the [GSM Pause Delay](https://manual.makerdao.com/parameter-index/core/param-gsm-pause-delay).

The GSM Pause Delay is currently set to **16 hours**.

This executive proposal includes an office-hours modifier that means that it **can only be executed between 14:00 and 21:00 UTC, Monday - Friday**. 

If this executive proposal does not pass within 30 days, then it will expire and can no longer have any effect on the Maker Protocol.
