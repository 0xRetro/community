The Maker Foundation Interim Risk Team has placed a Governance Poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) which presents a number of possible Dai Stability Fee adjustment options. Voters are now able to signal their support for one of the following Stability Fee changes: -4%, -3%, -2%, -1%, 0%, +1%, +2%, +3%, or +4%.

This Governance Poll ([FAQ](https://makerdao.com/en/faq/voting#what-is-governance-voting)) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, May 13 at 4 PM UTC, the results of which will inform an Executive Vote ([FAQ](https://makerdao.com/en/faq/voting#what-is-executive-voting)) which will go live on Friday, May 17, at 4 PM UTC.

## Review
The need to change the Stability Fee was discussed in the Governance call on Thursday, May 9. Please review the [Video](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLzkWCj8ywWNq5-90-Id6VPSsrk4OWVan), [Audio](https://soundcloud.com/makerdao/sets/governance-and-risk), [Transcript](https://github.com/makerdao/community/tree/master/governance/transcripts) and the online [discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/mkrgov/) to inform your position before voting.

Key factors under consideration for altering the Stability Fee are:

* Exchange price persists below $1
* Moderate inventory levels among market makers and prop desks
* Little attributable impact from the previous Stability Fee increases

## Action
**Vote for this proposal to signal your support to increase the Stability Fee by 4% bringing it to 23.5% per year.**

## Next Steps
* On the Friday following the conclusion of the poll, there will be an Executive Vote asking MKR token holders if they support or reject the change proposed by this Governance Poll.
* **This weekly cycle of Polling and Voting will continue until the community believes that stability has returned to the peg.**
