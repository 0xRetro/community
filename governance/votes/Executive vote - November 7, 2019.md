The Maker Foundation Interim Risk Team has placed an Executive Vote into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/), which will enable the community to vote for a new Dai Stability Fee of **5%** and a new Debt Ceiling of **120 million Dai**.

The Executive Vote ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/governance/governance#is-there-more-than-one-type-of-vote)) will continue until the number of votes surpasses the total in favor of the previous Executive Vote. This is a [continuous approval](https://community-development.makerdao.com/governance/governance#what-is-continuous-approval-voting) vote.

## Review

These changes were discussed in the Governance call on Thursday, November 7, 2019. Please review the [Video](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLzkWCj8ywWNq5-90-Id6VPSsrk4OWVan), [Audio](https://soundcloud.com/makerdao/sets/governance-and-risk), [Transcript](https://community-development.makerdao.com/governance/governance-and-risk-meetings/transcripts) (delayed by 24 to 48 hours), and the online [discussion](https://forum.makerdao.com/c/governance) to inform your position before voting.

The MakerDAO community is moving forward with an Executive Vote to determine whether it will enact the rates established by the [previous](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) Governance Poll.
