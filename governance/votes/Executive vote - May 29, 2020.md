The Maker Foundation Interim Governance Facilitator has placed an Executive Vote into the voting system, which will enable the community to approve the following alterations to the protocol:

- [Add USDC-B as a Collateral Type - May 25, 2020](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmzbjz2g3iu3jha1wgsid9xlgyb4923abzvsy7ecswmvek)
- [Add TUSD as a Collateral Type - May 25, 2020](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmnnn4mgmfq9fyud81rnyrz1u239amaycnrmkiaghjdr9e)

The Executive Vote ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-mcd-faqs/faqs#governance)) will continue until the number of votes surpass the total in favor of the previous Executive Vote. This is a [continuous approval](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-mcd-faqs/faqs/governance#what-is-continuous-approval-voting) vote.
