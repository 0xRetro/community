The Maker Foundation Interim Governance Facilitator has placed an Executive Vote into the voting system, which will enable the community to approve a series of alterations to the protocol:

- [Set the GSM delay to 24 hours](https://blog.makerdao.com/governance-security-module-gsm/)
- [Exclude the Oracle Security Module (OSM) stop method from the GSM delay](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/addendum-to-the-current-poll-to-activate-the-governance-security-module/938)

The Executive Vote ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-scd-faqs/scd-faqs#governance)) will continue until the number of votes surpass the total in favor of the previous Executive Vote. This is a [continuous approval](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-scd-faqs/scd-faqs/governance#what-is-continuous-approval-voting) vote.

## Review

This change was discussed in the Governance call on Thursday, December 12.
