The Maker Foundation Interim Governance Facilitator has placed an Executive Vote into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/), which will enable the community to approve a series of fixes to the protocol:

- [**Upgrade the Debt Auction**](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/proposal-upgrading-the-flopper/835): A MCD bug was found that would prevent bidders from reclaiming their Dai after an Emergency Shutdown.
- [**Remove the SCD MKR OSM Delay**](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/proposal-remove-the-scd-mkr-oracle-security-module/837): Allow MKR prices to be read directly from the MKR/USD Medianizer to reduce price slippage during the migration process. 

The Executive Vote ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/governance/governance#is-there-more-than-one-type-of-vote)) will continue until the number of votes surpasses the total in favor of the previous Executive Vote. This is a [continuous approval](https://community-development.makerdao.com/governance/governance#what-is-continuous-approval-voting) vote.
