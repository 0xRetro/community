The Maker Foundation Interim Governance Facilitator has placed an Executive Vote into the voting system, which will enable the community to approve a series of alterations to the protocol:

- [Raise the Sai Stability Fee from 3% to to 5%](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmbguffudtcjsqdenknu5miqyhiqdzxv6tteefoavfavuo)
- [Raise the Dai Savings Rate from 4% to 6%](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmcyrqgakfkkzxbrgexhnithttefsi2rwmkx9mpknwz8qh)
- [Raise the Dai Stability Fee from 4% to 6%](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmdszgqubhpmdgjyeug9huvhz3ccvaj9kfbwcxu816gfv2)


The Executive Vote ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-scd-faqs/scd-faqs#governance)) will continue until the number of votes surpass the total in favor of the previous Executive Vote. This is a [continuous approval](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-scd-faqs/scd-faqs/governance#what-is-continuous-approval-voting) vote.
