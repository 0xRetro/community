The Interim Risk Team has placed an Executive Vote into the voting system which will enable the community to approve the following alterations to the protocol.



* Increase the USDC-B Debt Ceiling to 50 million
* Increase Max Auction Duration to 24 hours for all collateral assets

The Risk Team has requested these emergency measures due to the recent pressure on the Dai peg.





The Executive Vote ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-mcd-faqs/faqs#governance)) will continue until the number of votes surpasses the total in favor of the previous Executive Vote. This is a [continuous approval](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-mcd-faqs/faqs/governance#what-is-continuous-approval-voting) vote.
