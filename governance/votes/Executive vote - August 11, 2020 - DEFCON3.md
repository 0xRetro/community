The Interim Risk Team has placed an Executive Vote into the voting system which will enable the community to approve the following alterations to the protocol.



* Increase the USDC-B Debt Ceiling to 50 million
* Enable the Liquidation Freeze for all collateral assets.

The Risk Team has requested these emergency measures due to the recent pressure on the Dai peg.

The Liquidation Freeze will prevent undercollateralized Vaults from being liquidated. Note that this does not apply to Vaults that have already begun the liquidation / auction process. Liquidations will remain disabled until reenabled with a subsequent Executive Vote.







The Executive Vote ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-mcd-faqs/faqs#governance)) will continue until the number of votes surpasses the total in favor of the previous Executive Vote. This is a [continuous approval](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-mcd-faqs/faqs/governance#what-is-continuous-approval-voting) vote.
