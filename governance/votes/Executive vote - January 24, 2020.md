The Maker Foundation Interim Governance Facilitator has placed an Executive Vote into the voting system, which will enable the community to approve alterations to the protocol:

- [Set the DSR Spread to 0.25%](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmayqxkr2avyqdvqqq2xudjmuiw3rr5tnsuhmpwm1jnfx4)
- [Raise the Dai Stability Fee from 6% to 8%](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmzhc5fcvv2jhqmgbugd6zy1mh6pffapdz7o6uqebgltjt)
- [Lower the Sai Debt Ceiling by 25 million to 45 million Sai](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmwspnkrb8tbvbmehmwrsjadexv9zbezxjqfjcstrd8jfc)
- [Raise the Dai ETH Debt Ceiling by 25 million to 125 million Dai](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmwspnkrb8tbvbmehmwrsjadexv9zbezxjqfjcstrd8jfc)

The Executive Vote ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-scd-faqs/scd-faqs#governance)) will continue until the number of votes surpass the total in favor of the previous Executive Vote. This is a [continuous approval](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-scd-faqs/scd-faqs/governance#what-is-continuous-approval-voting) vote.
