The Maker Foundation Interim Governance Facilitator has placed an Executive Vote into the voting system, which will enable the community to approve alterations to the protocol:

- [Raise the Sai Stability Fee from 5% to 9%](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmzhc5fcvv2jhqmgbugd6zy1mh6pffapdz7o6uqebgltjt)


The Executive Vote ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-scd-faqs/scd-faqs#governance)) will continue until the number of votes surpass the total in favor of the previous Executive Vote. This is a [continuous approval](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-scd-faqs/scd-faqs/governance#what-is-continuous-approval-voting) vote.
