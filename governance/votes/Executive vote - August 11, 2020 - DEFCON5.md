The Interim Risk Team has placed an Executive Vote into the voting system which will enable the community to approve the following alterations to the protocol.



* Disable the Liquidation Freeze for certain collateral assets. Assets whose liquidations were recently frozen will now be eligible for liquidation again. Assets that previously had liquidations turned off will continue to operate without liquidations.


The Executive Vote ([FAQ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-mcd-faqs/faqs#governance)) will continue until the number of votes surpasses the total in favor of the previous Executive Vote. This is a [continuous approval](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-mcd-faqs/faqs/governance#what-is-continuous-approval-voting) vote.
