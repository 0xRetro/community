# Executive Copy Principles

## Clarity

As the entity responsible for producing the executive copy, you must ensure:
* That the effects and impacts of the proposal if passed are made as clear as possible to voters.
* That the processes that have led to each item being included in the executive vote are made as transparent and easily understood as possible.
* That the identities (can be pseudonymous or at a entity level) of those responsible for publishing, writing and reviewing of the executive are as transparent as possible. 

The overall goal here is to eliminate ambiguity and confusion as much as reasonably possible. In an ideal world, voters should never need to ask or wonder why an item has been included in an executive, what will happen if it passes or which entities are responsible for the executive and its contents.

Clarity is important because it reduces the risk of disruption, drama and a breakdown of legitimacy around the governance process. 

## Informed Voters

As the entity responsible for producing the executive copy, you must ensure that voters have access to sufficient information to vote (or not) in an informed way. This might include:
* Links to any documentation or discussion regarding the actions included in the executive.
* A summary of the actions included in the executive, created by an unbiased and knowledgable third party.
* Links to any analysis that has been published by DAO-funded entities regarding the actions within the executive.
* Links to well maintained resources describing the nature of any parameters that may be changed if the executive proposal passes.

Again, the overarching theme here is legitimacy. Voters should not later regret their vote because they were not able to get a full understanding of the actions they were called to vote on.

## Prioritization of Information

As the entity responsible for producing the executive copy, you should try to ensure that the necessary information is organized such that there is the greatest possible chance for voters to read, understand and consider the actions on which they are voting. The above principles (clarity and access to information) taken to extreme can result in a dry and lengthy document accompanying a given vote, but this must be avoided. 

Strategic use of hyperlinks and text formatting should both be used where possible to make the executive copy shorter and more readable. Templates should be reviewed regularly to ensure that they are not needlessly adding to length.
